{"name":"Kaggle home site quote conversion","tagline":"Machine Learning And Challenge Kaggle","body":"###  Welcome to GitHub Repository for Kaggle home site quote conversion.\r\nBefore asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. \r\n\r\nUsing an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments. \r\n\r\n![](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/4699/media/iStock_insurancehands300.png)\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe autor for this proyect:\r\n* Carlos Jesús Fernández Basso (@cjferba)\r\n* Ismael González Marín (@Xmael)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
